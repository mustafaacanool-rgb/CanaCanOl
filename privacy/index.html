  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Currently, the application only uses <strong>Firebase</strong> services provided by Google. Firebase may collect anonymous usage data such as device model, operating system version, crash reports, and general app interaction statistics. This information does not personally identify users and is used solely to improve app performance and stability.</p>

  <p>The collected data may be used for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To monitor and improve app performance,</li>
    <li>To fix bugs and crashes,</li>
    <li>To enhance user experience and develop new features,</li>
    <li>To analyze general app usage trends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>At this time, the app only integrates with <strong>Google Firebase</strong> services. However, in the future, we may use additional services such as analytics tools, advertising networks, or push notification providers.  
  If any new third-party service is added, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

  We take reasonable measures to ensure data security and protect against unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised accordingly.
